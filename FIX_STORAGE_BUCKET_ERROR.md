### **Step 3: Configure Bucket Policies**

     Policy name: Public read access
     Allowed operation: SELECT
     Target roles: public
     USING expression: true
     ```
   - Click "Review" then "Save policy"

5. **Create Policy 2: Authenticated Upload**
   - Click "New Policy" again
   - Fill in:
     ```

     ```
   - Click "Review" then "Save policy"

#### **Option B: Using SQL Editor (Faster)**

1. **Go to SQL Editor** (left sidebar)

2. **Click "+ New Query"**

3. **Copy and paste this SQL:**

```sql
-- Storage policies for product-images bucket
CREATE POLICY "Public read access"
  ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
  USING (bucket_id = 'product-images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload"
  ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
  WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'product-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can update"
  ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
  USING (bucket_id = 'product-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete"
  ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
  USING (bucket_id = 'product-images' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

4. **Click "Run"** button

5. **Wait for success message**

---

### **Step 4: Verify Bucket is Ready**

1. **Go back to Storage** (left sidebar)

2. **Check bucket exists:**
   - ‚úÖ `product-images` appears in bucket list
   - ‚úÖ Shows "Public" badge
   - ‚úÖ Shows 0 objects (empty)

3. **Click on bucket name** to open it

4. **Try uploading a test file:**
   - Click "Upload file" button
   - Select any image from your computer
   - Should upload successfully
   - If successful, you can delete the test file

---

### **Step 5: Test in Admin Panel**

1. **Go to your admin panel:**
   - Local: http://localhost:3001/admin/products
   - Live: https://your-site.vercel.app/admin/products

2. **Log in** with admin credentials

3. **Click "Add Product"**

4. **Click the upload area**

5. **Select an image file**

6. **Verify:**
   - ‚úÖ Upload progress shows
   - ‚úÖ Success toast appears: "1 image(s) uploaded successfully!"
   - ‚úÖ Image appears in preview grid
   - ‚úÖ No "Bucket not found" error

7. **Fill in product details and save**

8. **Verify image saved:**
   - Product appears in list with image
   - Image displays correctly

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**

### **Error: "Bucket not found" still appears**

**Possible Causes:**

1. **Bucket name is wrong**
   - ‚úÖ Must be exactly: `product-images` (lowercase, with hyphen)
   - ‚ùå Not: `product_images`, `productimages`, `Product-Images`

2. **Bucket is not public**
   - Go to Storage ‚Üí Click bucket ‚Üí Check "Public" badge
   - If not public, delete and recreate with "Public bucket" checked

3. **Browser cache**
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or clear browser cache

4. **Not logged in**
   - Make sure you're logged in to admin panel
   - Check session in browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Local Storage

---

### **Error: "Permission denied" when uploading**

**Cause:** Storage policies not configured

**Solution:**
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí `product-images` ‚Üí Policies tab
2. Verify 4 policies exist (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
3. If missing, run the SQL from Step 3 Option B above

---

### **Error: "Invalid bucket configuration"**

**Cause:** Bucket settings incorrect

**Solution:**
1. Delete the bucket
2. Recreate with correct settings:
   - Name: `product-images`
   - Public: ‚úÖ Checked
   - File size limit: 5 MB
   - Allowed MIME types: `image/*`

---

### **Images upload but don't display**

**Cause:** Bucket is not public

**Solution:**
1. Go to Storage ‚Üí Click `product-images`
2. Click "Settings" (gear icon)
3. Check "Public bucket" is enabled
4. If not, you need to recreate the bucket as public

---

## üìã **Verification Checklist**

After completing the steps above, verify:

- [ ] Bucket `product-images` exists in Supabase Storage
- [ ] Bucket shows "Public" badge
- [ ] Bucket has 4 policies configured (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- [ ] Can upload test file in Supabase dashboard
- [ ] Can upload image in admin panel
- [ ] No "Bucket not found" error
- [ ] Image appears in preview grid
- [ ] Image saves with product
- [ ] Image displays in product list
- [ ] Image displays on product page

---

## üéØ **Why This Happened**

### **Root Cause:**

The SQL schema in `lib/supabase/schema.sql` includes commands to create the storage bucket:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for product images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public) 
VALUES ('product-images', 'product-images', true);
```

**However, this SQL command might fail silently if:**
1. You don't have permission to insert into `storage.buckets` table
2. The SQL was run partially and this section was skipped
3. There was an error that wasn't displayed

**Solution:** Create the bucket manually through the Supabase Dashboard (which uses proper APIs)

---

## üìä **Bucket Configuration Summary**

### **Bucket Settings:**
```
Name: product-images
Type: Public
Access: Public read, Authenticated write
File size limit: 5 MB (recommended)
Allowed types: image/* (recommended)
```

### **Policies:**
```
1. SELECT (public) - Anyone can view images
2. INSERT (authenticated) - Logged-in users can upload
3. UPDATE (authenticated) - Logged-in users can update
4. DELETE (authenticated) - Logged-in users can delete
```

### **URL Format:**
```
https://ijviarfucnpjakjknzzs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/product-images/{filename}
```

---

## üîê **Security Notes**

### **Why Public Bucket?**
- Product images need to be visible to all website visitors
- Public bucket allows direct image URLs without authentication
- Still secure because only authenticated users can upload/delete

### **Why Authenticated Write?**
- Only logged-in admin users can upload images
- Prevents random people from uploading to your storage
- Protects against abuse and unwanted content

### **File Size Limit:**
- 5MB limit prevents huge uploads
- Keeps storage costs reasonable
- Forces image optimization
