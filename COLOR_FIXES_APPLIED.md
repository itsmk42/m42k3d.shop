# 🎨 Color Fixes Applied

## Issue Identified

**Problem:** The "Shop Now" and "Explore Products" buttons on the homepage had text that was too light/grey and not visible enough against the white button background.

**Location:** Homepage (`app/page.tsx`)
- Hero section "Shop Now" button
- CTA section "Explore Products" button

---

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Hero Section "Shop Now" Button

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button size="lg" className="bg-white text-blue-600 hover:bg-gray-100 flex items-center gap-2">
  Shop Now
  <ArrowRight className="w-5 h-5" />
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Button size="lg" className="bg-white !text-blue-600 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:!text-blue-700 flex items-center gap-2 font-semibold">
  Shop Now
  <ArrowRight className="w-5 h-5" />
</Button>
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `!text-blue-600` with `!important` flag to ensure color is applied
- ✅ Added `hover:!text-blue-700` for darker hover state
- ✅ Added `font-semibold` to make text bolder and more visible

### 2. CTA Section "Explore Products" Button

**Before:**
```tsx
<Button size="lg" className="bg-white text-blue-600 hover:bg-gray-100">
  Explore Products
</Button>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Button size="lg" className="bg-white !text-blue-600 hover:bg-gray-100 hover:!text-blue-700 font-semibold">
  Explore Products
</Button>
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added `!text-blue-600` with `!important` flag to ensure color is applied
- ✅ Added `hover:!text-blue-700` for darker hover state
- ✅ Added `font-semibold` to make text bolder and more visible

---

## 🎯 Why These Changes Work

### 1. **`!important` Flag (`!text-blue-600`)**
   - Ensures the text color overrides any default button styles
   - Tailwind's `!` prefix adds CSS `!important`
   - Prevents the color from being overridden by other classes

### 2. **Hover State (`hover:!text-blue-700`)**
   - Provides visual feedback when hovering
   - Darker blue (#1447e6) is more visible than regular blue
   - Maintains consistency with the design

### 3. **Font Weight (`font-semibold`)**
   - Makes text thicker and more prominent
   - Improves readability on white backgrounds
   - Increases visual weight of the button text

## ✅ Verification

## 📊 Other Buttons Checked

I also verified all other buttons in the application to ensure they have proper contrast:

### ✅ Buttons That Are Fine:

| Button | Location | Style | Status |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|
| Add to Cart | Product cards | Blue bg, white text | ✅ Good |
| View All | Featured section | Blue border, blue text | ✅ Good |
| Proceed to Checkout | Cart page | Blue bg, white text | ✅ Good |
| Continue Shopping | Cart page | Blue border, blue text | ✅ Good |
| Login | Admin page | Blue bg, white text | ✅ Good |
| Add Product | Admin products | Blue bg, white text | ✅ Good |
| Edit/Delete | Admin products | Icon buttons | ✅ Good |

**All other buttons have proper contrast and don't need changes.**

## 🐛 Additional Issue Found

While testing, I noticed a Supabase API key error in the console:

```
Error fetching featured products: {
  message: 'Invalid API key',
  hint: 'Double check your Supabase `anon` or `service_role` API key.'
}
```

**This is a separate issue** and doesn't affect the color fixes. To resolve:
1. Check `.env.local` file
2. Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` is correct
3. Copy the key from Supabase dashboard (Settings > API)
4. Restart the dev server
