# Complete Setup Guide for M42K3D Shop

This guide will walk you through setting up your e-commerce website from scratch.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including Next.js, React, Supabase, Zustand, and more.

## Step 2: Create a Supabase Project

1. Go to [https://supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Sign up or log in
4. Click "New Project"
5. Fill in:
   - **Project name:** m42k3d-shop (or your preferred name)
   - **Database password:** Create a strong password (save this!)
   - **Region:** Choose closest to your location
6. Click "Create new project"
7. Wait for the project to be created (takes 1-2 minutes)

## Step 3: Set Up the Database

1. In your Supabase dashboard, click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar
2. Click "New Query"
3. Open the file `lib/supabase/schema.sql` from this project
4. Copy all the SQL code
5. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)
7. You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this is correct!

This creates:
- `products` table for storing your 3D printed items
- `categories` table for product categories
- `orders` table for customer orders
- `product-images` storage bucket for images
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection

## Step 4: Get Your Supabase API Keys

1. In Supabase dashboard, click "Settings" (gear icon) in the left sidebar
2. Click "API" under Project Settings
3. You'll see two important keys:
   - **Project URL** (looks like: https://xxxxx.supabase.co)
   - **anon public** key (long string starting with "eyJ...")
4. Keep this page open - you'll need these in the next step

## Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `.env.local` file in your project
2. Replace the placeholder values:

```env
# Replace with your actual Supabase URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co

# Replace with your actual anon key
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...

# For service role key (optional for now):
# Go to Settings > API > service_role key (keep this secret!)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

3. Save the file

**Important:** Never commit `.env.local` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

## Step 6: Create an Admin User

1. In Supabase dashboard, click "Authentication" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Users" tab
3. Click "Add User" button
4. Choose "Create new user"
5. Fill in:
   - **Email:** your-admin-email@example.com
   - **Password:** Create a strong password
   - **Auto Confirm User:** Check this box
6. Click "Create User"

This is the account you'll use to log into the admin panel.

## Step 7: Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will start at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Step 8: Test the Website

## Step 9: Access the Admin Panel

   - "Manage Orders" (coming soon)
