-- Fix Multiple Permissive Policies Performance Warnings
-- Resolves conflicts between FOR SELECT and FOR ALL policies
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- ============================================================================
-- PROBLEM: FOR ALL includes SELECT, causing multiple policies for SELECT ops
-- SOLUTION: Split admin policies into specific INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE policies
